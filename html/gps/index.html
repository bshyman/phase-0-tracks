    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</strong>
        <div>Semantic elements have self-explanantory titled tags. They are tags that describe the action they perform or are descriptive of the content within the the tags.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</strong>
            <div> This question is not as clear as it should be. The order the browser uses to display elements is determined by in what order some semantic elements appear. Typically, CSS would load before HTML because many devs seem to put CSS in the #Head tag.
            </div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</strong>
            <div> I keep learning how useful and versatile Sublime is. The ability to install packages and now snippets is a huge time saver and efficiency increaser. I can definitely see how much time snippets could save a dev throughout the course of an entire project.
            </div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept?</strong>
            <div>I still have some difficulty with Github and repositories. I know that the more I use it the more clear my understanding will become. I could also watch a few videos or do some other reading.
            </div>
