# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system used for allowing multiple users to simultaneously collaborate and organize projects
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is initially an identical clone of a working code. A branch is used to modify the original code without putting it into effect.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit saves the changes a user has just made. A good commit message would clearly describe what changes the user had made at the time of the commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is an error message displayed when a user is unable to merge a branch with the master. This can happen for a few reasons and Git can tell the user to fix the conflicts before proceeding.
