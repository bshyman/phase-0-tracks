I plan on researching jQuery by using a mix of Treehouse videos, Codeacademy and the official jQuery docs 


The online docs are easy to read and will be very helpful. Treehouse started off a little too quick but after going through codeacademy it all clicked. Codeacademy was the most effective beginners learning too for me once again
